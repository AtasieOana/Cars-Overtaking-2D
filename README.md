# 2D Cars Overtaking using OpenGL

## Concept
The project involves a 2D overtaking of a normal car by a police car on a mission, overtaking achieved with the help of transformations (translation, scaling and rotation).

## Content
To create the overtaking frame, the street was represented by a rectangle, and its markings by points joined by lines. Also, on the side of the street there is a green space made by two rectangles. This green space contains plants represented by rectangles on which textures have been applied. For the four rectangles (used for cars) to move on axis, translations were used.

## Rendering
The graphics are drawn using OpenGL, along with additional GLM and SOIL libraries to make modeling matrix calculations easier and to allow texturing.
